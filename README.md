The aim of this short project is to get familiar with OpenCV library and using Python for image manipulation. I'm going to create a timelapse of me working recorded with my computer camera. Let's see how it works out!

My initial plan was to do face detection using Haar Cascades, but it doesn't seem to work very well. This solution highly depends on the position of my head and I decided to use tools from dlib library. However, I have problemswith installing this library on Windows 10 and I'll probably spent the rest of this day trying to make it work...
